# Technical Documentation for Screen Recording Chrome Extension Backend API


This technical documentation provides an overview and explanation of a Flask-based API for a backend system designed to work in conjunction with a screen recording Chrome extension. The API allows users to upload screen recording files to a designated folder on their desktop, retrieve the contents of this folder, and find the most recently recorded video file. Below are the key components and functionalities of the code:




## 1. Introduction
This Flask API serves as a backend system for managing screen recording files generated by a Chrome extension. It provides endpoints to upload screen recording files, retrieve the list of recorded files in a specified folder, and find the most recently recorded video file.

## 2. Dependencies
The code uses the following Python libraries and modules:

Flask: A web framework for building web applications in Python.
shutil: A module for file operations.

pathlib: A module for working with filesystem paths.

os: A module for operating system-related functions.

## 3. Configuration
DESKTOP_PATH: This variable is set to the user's desktop directory using the Path.home() method.

FOLDER_NAME: The name of the folder where screen recording files will be stored.

FOLDER_PATH: The full path to the folder where screen recording files will be saved. It is created if it does not already exist.

NO_CONTENT_RESPONSE: A message indicating that no screen recording files are currently saved

## 4. Endpoints
a. /api/upload (POST)
Description: This endpoint allows users to upload screen recording files to the designated folder on their desktop.

Request Parameters:

file: The screen recording file to be uploaded.
Response:

If the file is successfully uploaded, it returns a JSON response with a "File saved successfully" message and a status code of 201 (Created).
If the request is invalid or encounters an error, it returns an appropriate error message with a status code of 400 (Bad Request) or 500 (Internal Server Error).

b. /api/videos (GET)
Description: This endpoint retrieves the list of screen recording files present in the designated folder on the user's desktop.

Response:

If there are no screen recording files in the folder, it returns a JSON response with a "No saved record YET." message and a status code of 200 (OK).

If there are screen recording files in the folder, it returns a JSON response containing the list of file names with a status code of 200 (OK).

c. /api/video/recent (GET)
Description: This endpoint finds and returns the most recently recorded screen recording file in the designated folder on the user's desktop.

Response:

If there are no screen recording files in the folder, it returns a JSON response with a "No saved record YET." message and a status code of 200 (OK).

If there are screen recording files in the folder, it identifies the most recently recorded file and returns its name in a JSON response with a status code of 200 (OK).
## 5. Error Handling
The code includes error handling for various scenarios, such as missing files, empty file names, and server errors. Appropriate error messages are returned along with the corresponding HTTP status codes to inform the client of the issue.
## 6. Running the Application
The code includes a conditional check if __name__ == "__main__" to run the Flask application with debugging enabled if the script is executed directly.

## 7. Usage
To use this API in conjunction with the screen recording Chrome extension, follow these steps:

1)Run the Python script to start the Flask application.
2)Configure the Chrome extension to send screen recording files to the /api/upload endpoint of the API.
3)Upload screen recording files using the Chrome extension.

4)Retrieve the list of recorded files in the folder using the /api/videos endpoint.

5)Find the most recently recorded screen recording file using the /api/video/recent endpoint.

## 8. Security Considerations
The code does not include authentication or authorization mechanisms. Consider adding these for security in a production environment.
Ensure that the API is used only in trusted environments, as it allows file operations on the user's desktop.
