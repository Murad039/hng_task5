Technical Documentation for Flask API for Managing Desktop Videos
This technical documentation provides an overview and explanation of a Flask-based API for managing video files on a user's desktop. The API allows users to upload video files to a designated folder on their desktop, retrieve the contents of this folder, and get information about the most recently modified video file. Below are the key components and functionalities of the code:

1. Introduction
This Flask API serves as a simple file management system for video files. It provides endpoints to upload video files, retrieve the list of video files in a specified folder, and find the most recently modified video file within that folder.

2. Dependencies
The code uses the following Python libraries and modules:

Flask: A web framework for building web applications in Python.
shutil: A module for file operations.
pathlib: A module for working with filesystem paths.
os: A module for operating system-related functions.
3. Configuration
DESKTOP_PATH: This variable is set to the user's desktop directory using the Path.home() method.
FOLDER_NAME: The name of the folder where video files will be stored.
FOLDER_PATH: The full path to the folder where video files will be saved. It is created if it does not already exist.
NO_CONTENT_RESPONSE: A message indicating that no video files are currently saved.
4. Endpoints
a. /api/upload (POST)
Description: This endpoint allows users to upload video files to the designated folder on their desktop.

Request Parameters:

file: The video file to be uploaded.
Response:

If the file is successfully uploaded, it returns a JSON response with a "File saved successfully" message and a status code of 201 (Created).
If the request is invalid or encounters an error, it returns an appropriate error message with a status code of 400 (Bad Request) or 500 (Internal Server Error).
b. /api/videos (GET)
Description: This endpoint retrieves the list of video files present in the designated folder on the user's desktop.

Response:

If there are no video files in the folder, it returns a JSON response with a "No saved record YET." message and a status code of 200 (OK).
If there are video files in the folder, it returns a JSON response containing the list of video file names with a status code of 200 (OK).
c. /api/video/recent (GET)
Description: This endpoint finds and returns the most recently modified video file in the designated folder on the user's desktop.

Response:

If there are no video files in the folder, it returns a JSON response with a "No saved record YET." message and a status code of 200 (OK).
If there are video files in the folder, it identifies the most recently modified file and returns its name in a JSON response with a status code of 200 (OK).
5. Error Handling
The code includes error handling for various scenarios, such as missing files, empty file names, and server errors. Appropriate error messages are returned along with the corresponding HTTP status codes to inform the client of the issue.

6. Running the Application
The code includes a conditional check if __name__ == "__main__" to run the Flask application with debugging enabled if the script is executed directly.

7. Usage
To use this API, follow these steps:

Run the Python script to start the Flask application.
Use a tool like curl or Postman to make requests to the API endpoints.
Upload video files using the /api/upload endpoint.
Retrieve the list of video files in the folder using the /api/videos endpoint.
Find the most recently modified video file using the /api/video/recent endpoint.
8. Security Considerations
The code does not include authentication or authorization mechanisms. Consider adding these for security in a production environment.
Ensure that the API is used only in trusted environments as it allows file operations on the user's desktop.
9. Conclusion
This Flask API provides basic file management capabilities for video files on a user's desktop. It can be extended and customized to include additional features and security measures based on specific requirements.
